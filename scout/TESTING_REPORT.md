## Summary
The SCOUT backup and restore system has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. All core functionality works as expected:

- **Manual backups** create complete snapshots of all collections
- **Automated daily backups** run on schedule with configurable retention
- **Selective restore** allows restoring specific collections while preserving others
- **Full restore** replaces entire database from backup
- **Backup management** provides complete oversight and cleanup capabilities
- **Security** ensures only authorized admins can perform backup operations
- **Performance** handles realistic data volumes efficiently
- **Error handling** provides clear feedback for all failure scenarios

The system is production-ready and provides comprehensive data protection for the SCOUT inventory management application.
